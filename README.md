# Custom Hooks

## Learning Goals

- Refactor existing React code into custom hooks

## Introduction

One of the most powerful features of React hooks is that they give us the
ability to share logic and state between multiple components by writing our own
**custom hooks**. You've already encountered some custom hooks: the `useParams`
and `useHistory` hooks from React Router are hooks that let us access the
`params` and `history` objects from React Router in any component we want. In
this lesson, you'll learn how to create your own custom hooks by extracting
hooks-related logic out of components and into a reusable hook function...

## Setup

This lesson has some starter code for a blog site using React Router. The data
for the blog is saved in a `db.json` file, which we'll serve up using
`json-server`. To get started, run `npm install`. Then, run `npm run server` to
run our `json-server` backend in one terminal tab. Open another terminal tab and
run `npm start` to run our React frontend.

We'll be focusing on two components: the `HomePage` and `ArticlePage`
components. Make sure to run the app and familiarize yourself with the code
before moving on.

## Extracting Custom Hooks

In both the `HomePage` and `ArticlePage` components, you'll notice that we are
using the `useEffect` hook in order to set the document title. The [document
title][title] is an important part of any website, because it:

- is displayed in the browser tab
- is also displayed in the browser history
- helps with accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO)

Since we have similar logic for updating the title in both of our components
(and we might want this functionality in other components as our app grows),
this logic is a good candidate for a custom hook! Let's start by creating a new
file for our custom hook: `/src/hooks/useDocumentTitle.js`. Let's take the
`useEffect` code from the `HomePage` component and place it in that file, inside
a function called `useDocumentTitle`:

```jsx
// src/hooks/useDocumentTitle.js
import { useEffect } from "react";

function useDocumentTitle() {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = "Underreacted | Home";
  }, []);
}

export default useDocumentTitle;
```

There are a couple important things going on with this custom hook already, so
let's review.

So far, any time we've wanted to use a React hook (like `useState` or
`useEffect`), we've only been able to do so inside of our React components (not
inside of any other JavaScript functions).

**Custom hooks also allow us to call React hooks**, so long as we call our
custom hook from a React component.

Another important convention to note here: the name of our custom hook starts
with the word `use`. This is a signal to React (and ESLint) that our hook should
follow the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html), and also
a signal to other developers that this code is meant to be used as a React hook.

## Using our Custom Hook

Now that we've extracted this custom hook to its own file, we can import it and
use it in our `HomePage` component:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import About from "./About";
import ArticleList from "./ArticleList";
import useDocumentTitle from "../hooks/useDocumentTitle";

function HomePage() {
  // fetch data for posts

  // set the document title
  useDocumentTitle();

  // return ...
}

export default HomePage;
```

After that update, our component should work the same. But now our `HomePage`
component doesn't have to worry about the logic for updating the document title:
it just needs to call the `useDocumentTitle` hook, which will handle that work.

Updating our `ArticlePage` component won't quite work with our new custom hook
just yet, since the title is dynamic in this component:

```jsx
// src/components/ArticlePage.js
function ArticlePage() {
  //...

  const pageTitle = post ? `Underreacted | ${post.title}` : "Underreacted";
  useEffect(() => {
    // depends on the page title
    document.title = pageTitle;
  }, [pageTitle]);

  //...
}
```

To solve this, we can update our `useDocumentTitle` hook to accept an argument
of the page title:

```jsx
function useDocumentTitle(pageTitle) {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = pageTitle;
  }, [pageTitle]);
}
```

Now, both our components can use this custom hook by passing in a page title
when calling the hook:

```jsx
// src/components/ArticlePage.js
function ArticlePage() {
  //...

  const pageTitle = post ? `Underreacted | ${post.title}` : "Underreacted";
  useDocumentTitle(pageTitle);

  //...
}

// src/components/HomePage.js
function HomePage() {
  //...

  useDocumentTitle("Underreacted | Home");

  //...
}
```

## Returning Data from Custom Hooks

One other common piece of logic that is shared between our components is
fetching data from our API. Both the `ArticlePage` and `HomePage` share some
similarities with regards to data fetching:

- They both have a couple state variables related to data fetching (`isLoaded`,
  `posts`, `posts`)
- They both use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data as a side effect of rendering
  the component

By noticing these similarities, we can recognize what logic is coupled together and
what we'd need to extract in order to build out our custom hook.

Let's start with the `HomePage` component once again. Here's all of the logic that
is related to working with our API:

```jsx
// src/components/HomePage.js
function HomePage() {
  // fetch data for posts
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsLoaded(false);
    fetch("http://localhost:4000/posts")
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((posts) => {
        setPosts(posts);
        setIsLoaded(true);
      });
  }, []);

  // return ...
}
```

To start off with, let's take all this code out from our `HomePage` component
and create a new custom hook called `useQuery`, for querying data from our API:

```jsx
// src/hooks/useQuery.js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useQuery() {
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsLoaded(false);
    fetch("http://localhost:4000/posts")
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((posts) => {
        setPosts(posts);
        setIsLoaded(true);
      });
  }, []);
}

export default useQuery;
```

Just like before, we created a new file for our custom hook, and imported the
React hooks that our custom hook will use. We also gave our custom hook a name
that starts with `use`.

Unlike our previous custom hook, however, we're going to need to get some data
back out of this component. Specifically, when we're using this component, we'll
need access to two things:

- the data returned by the fetch request (`posts`)
- the `isLoaded` state

But how can we get this data **out** of the custom hook? Well, since a custom
hook is **just a function**, all we need to do is have our hook **return**
whatever data we need!

```jsx
// src/hooks/useQuery.js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useQuery() {
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsLoaded(false);
    fetch("http://localhost:4000/posts")
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((posts) => {
        setPosts(posts);
        setIsLoaded(true);
      });
  }, []);

  // return an *object* with the data and isLoaded state
  return {
    posts: posts,
    isLoaded: isLoaded,
  };
}

export default useQuery;
```

Now, in order to use this custom hook, we can call it from our `HomePage`
component, and **destructure** the return value to get the `posts` and
`isLoaded` state out:

```jsx
import useQuery from "../hooks/useQuery";

function HomePage() {
  // fetch data for posts
  const { posts, isLoaded } = useQuery();

  // ...
}
```

Our `HomePage` component is now significantly cleaner, because it no longer has
to worry about all the logic related to handling the fetch request and setting
state based on the response â€” all of that logic is now nicely encapsulated
in our `useQuery` hook!

In order to get this hook to work with the `ArticlePage` component as well, we
need to refactor it a bit and abstract away the logic that is specific to the
`HomePage` component's needs.

```jsx
// take in the url
function useQuery(url) {
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);
  // rename `posts` to a more generic `data`
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsLoaded(false);
    fetch(url)
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((data) => {
        setData(data);
        setIsLoaded(true);
      });
  }, [url]);
  // the url is now a dependency
  // we want to use the side effect whenever the url changes

  // return an *object* with the data and isLoaded state
  return { data, isLoaded };
}
```

Now, to use our more generic version of this hook in the `HomePage` component,
we just need to make a couple small changes:

```jsx
function HomePage() {
  const { data: posts, isLoaded } = useQuery("http://localhost:4000/posts");

  // ...
}
```

Since `useQuery` now accepts a URL for the fetch request, we must pass that URL
in when we call the hook. It now also returns an object with a more generic name
(`data`), so we can [re-name that variable][destructure rename] to `posts` when
destructuring.

The `useQuery` hook should now also work with our `ArticlePage` component:

```jsx
function ArticlePage() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const { data: post, isLoaded } = useQuery(
    `http://localhost:4000/posts/${id}`
  );

  // ...
}
```

With our custom hooks in place, the completed versions of the `HomePage` and
`ArticlePage` components are now both significantly shorter. Also, adding new
components to our application that need access to similar functionality is now
significantly easier, since we don't have to rewrite that functionality from
scratch in each new component.

**Note**: While our `useQuery` hook works nicely in this example, there are some
optimizations we could make to improve it, such as:

- Handling errors with `.catch` and adding an error state
- Using one state variable instead of
  [multiple state variables][react state faq], so that it doesn't re-render more
  than necessary
- [Using the useReducer hook instead of useState][use-reducer] to manage state
  transitions
- [Caching our fetched data][memoization] to prevent unnecessary network requests
- [Cancel the fetch][fetch cancel] if the component un-mounts before the fetch is
  complete

You're encouraged to try adding a few of these optimizations to this hook
yourself! There's also a version of the `useQuery` hook in the solution branch
called `useQueryAdvanced` that handles some of these optimizations. However,
there are also pre-built solutions out there, such as
[React Query][react query], that handle this logic (and more) with a pre-built
custom hook.

## Conclusion

Creating custom hooks allows us to share stateful logic across multiple
components. The ability to use custom hooks lets us create more concise
components that are focused more on the UI logic.

The React community has also embraced custom hooks in a big way â€” major
libraries like [React Redux][redux hooks] and [React Router][router hooks] use
custom hooks to provide a lot of their functionality, and there are lots of
[community generated custom hooks][awesome hooks] out there to explore and add
to your projects!
